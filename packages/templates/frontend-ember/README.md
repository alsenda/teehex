# frontend-ember template (planned)

Ember template is planned only and intentionally not scaffolded now.

## Why planned

Ember setup adds significant template/runtime complexity relative to current minimal-dependency goals.

## Planned integration

- Match the same backend API contract: `/api/todos`, `/api/todos/:id/toggle`, `/api/health`, `/api/heavy`.
- Preserve neobrutalist baseline styles and browser Worker demo behavior.
