# frontend-angular template (planned)

Angular template is planned, not generated yet.

## Why planned

Keeping this repository performance-first and minimal means avoiding a heavier Angular scaffold until CLI selection and Vercel deployment defaults are finalized.

## Planned integration

- Vite-compatible Angular setup (or the smallest viable Angular build pipeline).
- Same backend API contract: `/api/todos`, `/api/todos/:id/toggle`, `/api/health`, `/api/heavy`.
- Neobrutalist baseline styling and browser Worker heavy-task demo.
